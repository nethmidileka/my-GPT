# my-GPT
__Chat-Gpt model__

##Overview
This repository contains a ChatGPT model trained on custom prompts using the Langchain library and fine-tuned with the Hugging Face framework. The model is capable of generating human-like text responses given input questions or prompts. The training and testing of the model were conducted in Google Colab.

##Features

Utilizes the Langchain library for prompt-based generation.
Fine-tuned with the Hugging Face framework, leveraging the Falcon-7B model architecture.
Interactive interface for testing the model with custom prompts.
Configurable temperature parameter for controlling response creativity.
Maximum token limit to prevent excessively long responses.


##Usage
To use the ChatGPT model, follow these steps:

Open the provided Google Colab notebook (ChatGPT_Model.ipynb).
Install the required dependencies by running the provided setup cell.
Load the pre-trained model using the Langchain library.
Generate responses to prompts by calling the appropriate functions.

##Examples
###Example 1:

Prompt: "Who is the father of the Turing machine?"
